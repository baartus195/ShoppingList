# ShoppingList
It is my first simply program in Java. You can make shopping list and send email with it. (You have to set email and password in SendAnEmail class). I used library JavaMail API 1.4.7 which you can download from here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-eeplat-419426.html#javamail-1.4.7-oth-JPR
